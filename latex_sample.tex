% You may want to add hyperlinks to your document, which can be tricky
% to typeset because they often have weird symbols in them which LaTeX

\begin{document}

% The 'article' document class provides a simple way to make a title
% page: 
 

\chapter{A chapter on something}
\label{c:intro}
\section{A section}
\subsection{A sub-section}

Some text here. You can \emph{emphasise it} or {\bfseries make it
  bold-face} or {\large larger} or \emph{\bfseries\large combine those
  settings}. A random equation:
\begin{equation}
\label{e:Einstein1}
E=mc^2 \,.
\end{equation}
If you want to align equations, use either {\tt align} or {\tt
  aligned}. See the examples below. The difference is the way in which
the equation numbers are added. Here is the option with the two
equations receiving only one number:
\begin{equation}
\label{e:Einstein2}
\begin{aligned}
E &= mc^2  \\
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi, t\rangle 
  &= \hat{H} |\psi,t\rangle\,,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and here is the one where every equation gets its own number:
\begin{align}
\label{e:Einstein3}
E &= mc^2  \\
\end{align}
