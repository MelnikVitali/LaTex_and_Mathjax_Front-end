### A sub-section

Some text here. You can *emphasise it* or **make it bold-face** or
larger or ***combine those settings***. A random equation:
$$\label{e:Einstein1}
E=mc^2 \,.$$ If you want to align equations, use either `align` or
` aligned`. See the examples below. The difference is the way in which
the equation numbers are added. Here is the option with the two
equations receiving only one number: $$\label{e:Einstein2}
\begin{aligned}
E &= mc^2  \\
i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |\psi, t\rangle
&= \hat{H} |\psi,t\rangle\,,
\end{aligned}$$ and here is the one where every equation gets its own
number: $$\begin{aligned}
\label{e:Einstein3}
E &= mc^2  \\\end{aligned}$$
